# DIALOG SYSTEM

Coinciding with Alexander Freed's, a best-seller novelist and professional in the industry with games such as Mass effect or Dragon Age, the creators of video games are very bad at dealing with the interaction of dialogues, and the reason is basically the complexity What it entails, it is easier to present a non-interactive story with a good narrative than to manage the complexity of a story with thousands and thousands of dialogue nodes in which each represents a piece of a possible ending. And the most important, "Games are remembered for their gameplay instead for their dialogue".
